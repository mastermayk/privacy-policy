    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="small"><strong>App:</strong> Crypto Hustlers U</p>
    <p class="small"><strong>Effective date:</strong> <span id="effectiveDate">[REPLACE_WITH_EFFECTIVE_DATE]</span></p>

    <p>
      Crypto Hustlers U (“we”, “our”, or “us”) respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it through this Privacy Policy. This policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, with whom we share it, why we may share it, and your choices about such uses.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Scope</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy applies to information collected when you use the Crypto Hustlers U mobile application (the “App”), including any features such as lessons, quizzes, AI Mentor, video content, and in-app advertising.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>2.1 Information You Provide</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Account information:</strong> When you register, we collect your email and a username you choose. We may also store optional profile data like an avatar.</li>
      <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> We store (via Firebase Authentication) credentials used to sign you in (email/password or other sign-in providers you choose).</li>
      <li><strong>User generated content:</strong> Messages you send to the AI Mentor, quiz responses, feedback, or other content you type into the app.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.2 Automatically Collected Information</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Device & usage data:</strong> Device identifiers, OS version, app version, crash reports, log information, and feature usage (how you use lessons, quizzes, and the AI Mentor).</li>
      <li><strong>Analytics:</strong> Anonymous or pseudonymous analytics (via Google Analytics for Firebase or similar) to improve the app experience and measure usage.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.3 Ads & Monetization</h3>
    <p>If you view or interact with ads served in the app (Google Mobile Ads / AdMob), third-party ad networks may collect data for ad delivery and measurement. We do not control all of the data collection practices of these third parties—see <em>Third-Party Services</em> below.</p>

    <h3>2.4 Video Content</h3>
    <p>The App may embed or link to video content (for example, YouTube). When you view embedded or linked videos, that third party (e.g., YouTube/Google) may receive technical information (IP address, device identifiers) and may set cookies. We do not control how third parties use that data—see <em>Third-Party Services</em>.</p>

    <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide, operate and maintain the App and its features (lessons, quizzes, AI Mentor).</li>
      <li>Process account registration and authentication.</li>
      <li>Personalize and improve content, and recommend lessons.</li>
      <li>Monitor and analyze usage to measure and improve the App.</li>
      <li>Deliver targeted or contextual advertising (in accordance with ad providers’ policies).</li>
      <li>Detect, prevent, and address technical issues, fraud, or misuse.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services & Sharing</h2>
    <p>We may share data with the following service providers to operate and improve the App:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Firebase (Google):</strong> We use Firebase services (Authentication, Firestore, Crashlytics, Hosting, Cloud Functions) to store user data, authenticate users, and provide backend functionality. Firebase’s privacy practices and processing are governed by Google’s policies. See <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>Google Analytics for Firebase:</strong> For analytics and app performance.</li>
      <li><strong>Google Mobile Ads / AdMob:</strong> Ad serving and measurement. Ad partners may collect device identifiers and set cookies to serve and measure ads. We do not share personally identifiable information (PII) with advertisers unless you explicitly provide it.</li>
      <li><strong>YouTube / Google:</strong> For embedding or linking to video content. Viewing or streaming video may cause YouTube to collect data as described in its privacy policy.</li>
      <li><strong>AI backend providers:</strong> If an external API is used to produce AI Mentor responses, we may send the question and the optional lesson context to that API. We do not send account credentials. Check that API’s privacy policy for data handling practices.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Ads, Personalization & Opt-Out</h2>
    <p>We use advertising to support the app. Ad networks may collect information about your device and app usage for ad targeting. You can limit ad personalization at the device level (for example, via Android Ads Settings). To opt out of interest-based ads from Google, visit <a href="https://adssettings.google.com">Google Ad Settings</a>.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain your account data for as long as your account exists or as otherwise necessary to provide the App. We may retain anonymized or aggregated usage data indefinitely for analytics and business purposes.</p>

    <h2>7. Security</h2>
    <p>We implement industry-standard technical and organizational measures to protect your data (encryption in transit, secure Firebase storage rules, limited access). However, no service is 100% secure. Do not share sensitive personal information in free-text fields.</p>

    <h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is intended for users aged 13 and above (or the local legal age). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the minimum age required by applicable law. If you believe we have collected information from a child, contact us and we will promptly remove it.</p>

    <h2>9. Your Rights & Choices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Access & correction:</strong> You can review and correct your account information by signing into the App or by contacting us.</li>
      <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> You may request deletion of your account and personal data. We will remove your account profile and associated personal information from our active systems, subject to retention of backups or legal obligations.</li>
      <li><strong>Marketing communications:</strong> You may opt out of non-transactional messages by contacting us.</li>
      <li><strong>GDPR / CCPA:</strong> Residents of jurisdictions with privacy laws (e.g., EU, California) may have additional rights (access, portability, restriction, deletion). To exercise your rights, contact us at the address below. We will respond as required by law.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>11. International Data Transfers</h2>

    <h2>12. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post the updated policy in the App and update the “Effective date” above. Significant changes will be communicated via in-app notice or email if you are registered.</p>
